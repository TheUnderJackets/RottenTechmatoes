I did not get the chance to fully implement the search requests from Rotten
Tomatoes. However, I did stub out all of the methods that I will have. Here's
how the flow of control goes.
From the HomeActivity, using an OnClickListener for the searches or something,
call
RequestQueueSingleton.getInstance().add(RottenTomatoes.getMovies(stuff));
using the enums that I've made. This will update the singleton with the results
for the rest call. Then, get the results using the respective getter method
from the singleton in the search results activity to get the list of movies
or simply the movie itself.

I'm sorry that I could not fully implement this, but to make it up to you, I'll
make sure that everything compiles and works when I get back from MHacks. You
won't be able to see if your stuff works if you implement the stuff above since
I haven't fully implemented my stuff yet, so I recommend using dummy variables
and workarounds and use the above ^ once you know your stuff works.
